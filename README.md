### Projcts:
- (Contextual-News-Summary) - AI-Enhanced News Backend System- Developed a robust backend system that delivers intelligent news article retrieval and enrichment. The system supports multiple endpoints‚Äî/category, /source, /score, /nearby, and /search‚Äîto organize and serve news from a preloaded database. It leverages a large language model (LLM) to:
Interpret user queries and extract intent (e.g., topic, location, source preference)
Retrieve and rank relevant articles based on extracted intent and user proximity
Enrich articles with AI-generated summaries, key entities, and metadata
The system outputs clean, structured JSON responses, providing users with titles, sources, locations, and LLM-enhanced content for a more insightful and personalized news experience. [https://github.com/chetnacreate/Contextual_News/tree/main]
- (YouTube Video Summarization) Tool Using Python, YouTube Data API, and NLP - Designed and developed a Python-based tool that automates the extraction and summarization of YouTube video content. The system integrates the YouTube Data API to fetch video metadata and transcripts, then applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques to generate concise, meaningful summaries.
Key Features: Video Transcript Retrieval: Uses the YouTube Data API to identify videos based on keywords or URLs and programmatically retrieve their transcripts (when available).Text Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses transcripts by removing filler words, handling punctuation, and segmenting speech for better downstream NLP performance.NLP-Based Summarization: Applies techniques such as extractive or abstractive summarization using models like spaCy, Transformers (e.g., BART or T5), or custom-built logic to distill lengthy transcripts into coherent summaries.Keyword and Topic Extraction: Extracts key phrases, entities, and topics using named entity recognition (NER) and keyword extraction methods to enhance understanding of the video content.
User-Friendly Output: Returns the summary and metadata (e.g., title, channel, video URL, key topics) in a structured format such as JSON or plain text for easy integration or display.[https://github.com/vkr-code/YouTube-Transcript-Summarizer/tree/nltk]
This tool provides a fast and scalable way to consume and analyze YouTube video content, particularly useful for research, content indexing, and educational applications.
